# OBChat

When I applied to work for Gungho Online Entertainement as a software engineer they gave me a coding challenge to program a Telnet chat room.
I had so much fun with the challenge that I decided to take it further and turn it into a personal project of mine: OBChat.
Please explore OBChat and feel free to send me questions or comments at kenji.ob.taka@gmail.com.

Programmed with Django and Django Channels in Python.
